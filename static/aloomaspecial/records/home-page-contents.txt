Used ADJ Dumpster Rental for a full kitchen demo, 20-yard dumpster arrived at 7:30 AM, driver helped position it away from my sprinklers. Hauled the same afternoon when I finished early. Cheapest local dumpster rental prices I found, and no ‘overage’ trap like the big national chain quoted.<h2> – Mark T

Estate cleanup after my mom passed, so much stuff. They brought a 30-yard the same day I called, and the rep walked me through what could/couldn’t go in. Honest, compassionate, and efficient. I will use them again.<h2> – Lisa R

We rent 3–4 dumpsters a week during peak season. ADJ Dumpster Rental’s 40-yard roofing units are always clean, delivered on time, and priced fairly. Their driver even waited 10 minutes while we moved a ladder. That's a service.<h2> – Diego M
